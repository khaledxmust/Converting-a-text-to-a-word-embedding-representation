# Converting a text to a word embedding representation
Building a function to convert a text to a word embedding representation with "GoogleNews" word2vec.

Converting the tweet to a word embeddings representation, by summing the value of all words for which a word2Vec representation can be found and then dividing the resulting vector by their number, where each tweet is represented by 300 entries to train the classifier.

Classfiers:
1. Na√Øve Bayes Multinomial
2. SVM (Linear Kernel)
3. SVM (RBF)
4. Logistic Regression
